-WE ARE DELETING ALL OUR CODES ON #GIThub.
```
A lot has changed on github, good or bad, since Microsoft bought Github. Most are acceptable. But the worst thing is that Microsoft (Github) asks for $10 per month for CO-PILOT, their "OPEN SOURCE" project.

What does this mean?
Microsoft (Github) sells your code to me for $10, without your permission to sell.

What should we do?
We created a campaign https://giveupgithub.org , simply delete github. There are a lot of github alternatives and these companies don't sell your code for $10 a month like Microsoft.

Are you paying for CO-PILOT?
Attention! I or my friends have the right to sue you in projects where we see our code being used. No one, even Microsoft, can and should not sell the codes we share as Open Source. So let alone co-pilot until it's free...
